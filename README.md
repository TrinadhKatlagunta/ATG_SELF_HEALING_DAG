# Self-Healing Text Classification DAG (ATG Technical Assignment)

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project implements a **self-healing text classification pipeline** using a fine-tuned **DistilBERT** model and a **LangGraph DAG**. The pipeline uses prediction confidence to determine whether to accept a classification, request user clarification, or escalate with fallback logic. This supports reliable and human-in-the-loop NLP workflows.

## üì¶ Requirements

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Model Training

Fine-tune the DistilBERT model on the HuggingFace Emotion dataset:

```bash
python model/trainer.py
```

- Dataset used: `emotion`
- Labels: `['sadness', 'joy', 'love', 'anger', 'fear', 'surprise']`
- Model saved to: `model/model_files/`

---

## üß† LangGraph DAG Components

- **InferenceNode**: Runs the trained model on user input
- **ConfidenceCheckNode**: Accepts prediction if confidence >= 0.75
- **FallbackNode**: Asks user to confirm/correct label if confidence is too low

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Run the CLI

Launch the classification DAG from terminal:

```bash
python langgraph_pipeline/cli.py
```

Example flow:

```
Enter text: The movie was painfully slow and boring.
[InferenceNode] Predicted: sadness | Confidence: 74.25%
[ConfidenceCheckNode] Confidence too low ‚ùå ‚Äî triggering fallback...
[FallbackNode] Could you clarify your intent?
0. sadness
1. joy
2. love
3. anger
4. fear
5. surprise
Enter the correct label number (0-5), or press Enter to accept prediction:
```

## üìù Logs

All activity is logged in:

```
logs/pipeline.log
```
Contains:

- Prediction input, label, confidence
- Fallback decision & user corrections
- Final label
